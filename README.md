# CS161-CS162-Projects

I took the introductory computer science courses online at Oregon State University during the Winter 2020 and Spring 2020 terms. 
Added in this repo are the final projects from each course. 
CS161's final project was an implementation of FBoard, a game likely made up by my professor as I could not find any details about the game from my online research.
CS162's final project was an implementation of Gess, a board game combining Go and Chess.
